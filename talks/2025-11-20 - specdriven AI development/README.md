# EasyNotes

> **SpecKit Demo Project** - A fully functional note-taking app built entirely by AI using natural language specifications.

## Background Story

At [Zebbra](https://zebbra.ch), we had a company discussion about AI usage in development. The conversation revealed a critical challenge: **AI-assisted development can quickly become messy and unsustainable** without proper structure.

During a [lightning talk by Kusi](https://github.com/zebbra/lightning-talks/tree/main/talks/2025-11-11%20-%20AI%20mental%20model), he presented a mental model showing that **structure is essential for sustainable AI workflows**. This sparked the question: *Can we build production-ready applications using a structured, spec-driven approach with AI?*

*Visual from Kusi's talk showing the balance between autonomy and structure needed for sustainable AI development.*

### The Experiment

This project serves as a **proof of concept** to test whether SpecKit's structured approach can:
- ✅ Keep AI focused and on-track
- ✅ Generate maintainable, quality code
- ✅ Produce production-ready applications
- ✅ Work without human-written code

### Key Findings

**✅ It Works!** The structured approach successfully kept AI from getting lost in its own context. The constitution, specifications, and planning documents provided the guardrails needed for coherent code generation.

**⚠️ Trade-off:** While the structure enables sustainable AI development, it requires **significant upfront setup time**. Creating comprehensive specs, plans, and task breakdowns is time-intensive, but pays off in code quality and maintainability.

**💡 Insight:** Structure is not overhead—it's the foundation that makes AI-assisted development sustainable at scale.

## About This Project

This is a demonstration of [SpecKit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) workflow. The entire codebase was generated from natural language descriptions—**zero manual coding by humans**. The goal: prove AI can build production-ready applications from specs alone.

## What It Does

A modern note-taking app with:
- ✨ Rich text editing (Tiptap)
- 🏷️ Tag system with colors
- 📅 Calendar navigation
- 💾 Auto-save (2-second debounce)
- 🎨 Apple-inspired liquid glass UI

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** (App Router, Server Actions)
- **TypeScript** + **Prisma** + **PostgreSQL**
- **Tailwind CSS v4** (glassmorphism design)
- **Tiptap Editor**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup PostgreSQL database
createdb easynotes

# Configure .env
echo 'DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/easynotes"' > .env

# Run migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## The SpecKit Workflow

1. **📝 Specify** - Describe features in natural language
2. **📋 Plan** - AI generates implementation plan
3. **✅ Tasks** - Break down into actionable steps
4. **🚀 Implement** - AI writes all the code
5. **🎨 Polish** - Iterative refinements via conversation

**Result:** Production-ready app without writing code manually.

## How This App Was Built

Every line of code in this project was generated by AI through SpecKit commands. Here's the exact workflow used:

### 1️⃣ Constitution (`/speckit.constitution`)

```
Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience 
consistency, and performance requirements. Include governance for how these 
principles should guide technical decisions and implementation choices.
```

**Output:**
- ✅ [`constitution.md`](.specify/memory/constitution.md) - Project principles and governance
- ✅ [`plan-template.md`](.specify/templates/plan-template.md) - Updated with principles

### 2️⃣ Specification (`/speckit.specify`)

```
Develop EasyNotes, a cloud notes taking platform similar to Notion. It should 
allow users to create notes, do some easy formatting and adding tags to notes 
so they can be filtered instead of having a directory structure. In this initial 
phase we won't bother for an authentication system and just only implement the 
actual most important part of the application. If the user opens the application 
he will see two panels: On the left there will be a simple calendar and 
underneath is the filtering for tags functionality. In the right panel there 
are all notes listed and sorted by creation date. When clicking on a note it 
will open the note and you can do simple formatting over a toolbar which will 
be integrated or by just using Markdown. In a top panel you can then add one 
or multiple tags or even create new ones. For the tags you can also assign a 
color, either predefined or by custom HEX code. All notes should be stored in 
a database. Keep the UI simple and easy to use.
```

**Output:**
- ✅ [`spec.md`](specs/001-note-taking-core/spec.md) - Complete feature specification
- ✅ [`checklists/requirements.md`](specs/001-note-taking-core/checklists/requirements.md) - Detailed requirements

**Optional:** `/speckit.clarify` - Ask AI to clarify unclear requirements

### 3️⃣ Planning (`/speckit.plan`)

```
We will create this application by only using NextJS 15 for the front- and 
backend and the use of server actions instead of using traditional API routes. 
For the database we will use Postgres together with Prisma.
```

**Output:**
- ✅ [`research.md`](specs/001-note-taking-core/research.md) - Technology research
- ✅ [`plan.md`](specs/001-note-taking-core/plan.md) - Implementation plan
- ✅ [`data-model.md`](specs/001-note-taking-core/data-model.md) - Database schema design
- ✅ [`contracts/server-actions.md`](specs/001-note-taking-core/contracts/server-actions.md) - API contracts
- ✅ [`quickstart.md`](specs/001-note-taking-core/quickstart.md) - Setup guide

### 4️⃣ Task Breakdown (`/speckit.tasks`)

```
/speckit.tasks
```

**Output:**
- ✅ [`tasks.md`](specs/001-note-taking-core/tasks.md) - Dependency-ordered implementation tasks

### 5️⃣ Implementation (`/speckit.implement`)

```
/speckit.implement
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Full application code generated
- ✅ 29 components created
- ✅ Server actions implemented
- ✅ Database migrations
- ✅ Styling with glassmorphism
- ✅ All features working

### 6️⃣ Polish & Iteration

Through natural conversation:
- Fixed autosave issues
- Added liquid glass design
- Improved UX with placeholders
- Fixed validation bugs
- Enhanced modal styling

**Total Time:** ~2 hours from idea to production-ready app  
**Human Code Written:** 0 lines  
**AI Commands Used:** 5 SpecKit commands + conversational refinements
