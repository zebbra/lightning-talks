## From Vibes to Viability

The Context: **The "Vibe Coding" Honeymoon is Over**

The early *vibe coding* days are over. The fast, loose, unstructured way of "just talking to the AI, going with the vibe and seeing where it lands" is showing cracks. Vibing felt new, creative, and sometimes led to amazing showcases. But as the honeymoon fades, it's clear this isn't a sustainable or professional approach. Without structure, shared intent, and ownership, the results become inconsistent, unsafe, and unmaintainable. It's a shortcut that doesn't scale.

### The Thesis: **Autonomy is only viable with Structure**

My drawn "Autonomy vs. Structure" tries to make this tension visible. *Vibe coding* lives in the red zone — high autonomy, low structure — where things look impressive for a moment but collapse under real-world demands.
The goal is to move into the green zone: *viable engineering*, where increasing AI autonomy is balanced by stronger structure, shared governance, and common principles.

### The 4 + 1 Layer Mental AI Model

To make sense of that balance, I created a model with five layers that describe how humans and AI can collaborate at different maturity levels:

| **Layer** | **Focus** |
|-----------|------------|
| **0 – Explore** | Curiosity and idea discovery – shaping intent before building. |
| **1 – Assisted** | Augmented coding – using AI for smaller, well-defined tasks. |
| **2 – Agentic** | Working with reasoning agents – co-designing and solving more complex problems together. |
| **3 – Autonomous** | Guard-railed automation – delegating repeatable work safely. |
| **4 – Proactive (future)** | Self-managing systems that spot opportunities and improve themselves within set limits. |

The core idea is simple: **as autonomy increases, so must structure.**
The "vibe zone" in red is seductive but fragile; the "viable zone" in green is where solid engineering practices can potentially meet intelligent automation.

This is an attempt to find a common language and find a direction in which we're willing to walk as a team. The goal is to use AI in a sensible way and as a strong amplifier rather than a sweet sounding shortcut.

This is obviously just a start and we have to work on our "principles" and guidelines next. Those things -> Human ownership, architectural intent, and shared principles are the tools we use to turn AI's "creative chaos" into viable, sustainable, and professional impact.
